                    <br />
                    The <b>Content Picker</b> is a new dialog on PowerPoint for users to browse and search high quality stock images, cutout people images, 
                    icons, and stickers and use them in their PowerPoint slides to enrich the design. This is a product that I contributed to during my second 
                    Microsoft internship in Fall 2019. My role during the internship was to implement the search suggestion bar that provides the users with 
                    a rich collection of search terms to help broaden the horizon of what the content picker can provide. I learned skills in TypeScript, React, 
                    and Redux during the internship and worked closely with designers, engineers, and managers. To see this feature in action, visit

                    <b>Inspo App</b> is a web application that helps users with making plans collaboratively online with other users.
                    It is a person project that I am currently working on using skills in TypeScript, React, and Redux I learned from my Microsoft
                    internship. This website is still incomplete and I am working on it whenever I have free time. To see this website in action, visit

                    <br />
                    <b>Office Lens</b> is an intelligent document scanner that utilizes machine learning API to
                    precisely find
                    and crop documents from photos. During my Spring 2019
                    internship in Microsoft, I worked closely with designers and developers and integrated the Office
                    Lens feature into the <b>Windows 10 Photos App</b>. As a highly requested
                    feature from the Photos App users, the document scanner supports types such as document, whiteboard,
                    and business card. To try out the new feature, constantly check and
                    follow the Windows updates.

                    <br />
                    <b>Google CodeU</b> is a program hosted by Google where university students from all around the
                    world gather to learn and thrive by working together as a team.
                    During this program, my team collaboratively created a web chat app that supports real-time message
                    broadcasting and utilized the Google Cloud Vision API to intelligently tell users
                    details of the image sent in the chatroom.
                    This is the first real life project that I worked on where I learned the skills about working in a
                    team
                    and grew knowledge in real life production development cycle by doing rigorous testing and
                    code reviews with my peers. To learn more information about how to join this program, feel free to

                    <b>Network tracing</b> is a school project that I find particularly interesting, it opened the door
                    of
                    knowing what is really happening behind the scene on the largest infrastructure mankind has created.
                    During this project, I learned about all the protocols used and all the information required simply
                    to fetch a page. By getting hands on experience, the step by step workflow becomes clear and
                    easier to understand.

                    <b>Roids</b> is a text-based game written with python during the first term of my computer science
                    degree. This project is extremely simple as the main purpose of it is to get familiar with the
                    concepts of loops and statements. Despite it being simple, I enjoyed the team working game creation
                    process and some of the creative solutions we came up with to resolve certain obstacles. To learn
